# EMBODIOS Voice Demo

## Overview

EMBODIOS processes commands through **natural language text**. The "voice" aspect refers to the conversational nature of the interface, similar to how you would speak to a person.

For demonstration purposes, we've included a voice simulation that shows how audio input could work with proper hardware support.

## Text-Based Natural Language

EMBODIOS's primary interface is text:

```bash
> Turn on the LED
AI: Executing hardware control...
[HARDWARE] GPIO Pin 17 -> HIGH

> What's the temperature?
AI: Reading sensor...
[SENSOR] Temperature: 22.5°C
```

## Voice Simulation Demo

To see how voice control would work:

```bash
# Run the voice simulation
python -m embodi.demos.voice_simulation

# With text-to-speech simulation
python -m embodi.demos.voice_simulation --tts
```

The demo shows:
1. Simulated speech recognition
2. Word-by-word processing
3. Confidence levels
4. Recognition errors

## Real Voice Integration

For actual voice control, you would need:

1. **Audio Hardware Drivers** in the kernel
2. **Speech Recognition** (e.g., Whisper model)
3. **Wake Word Detection** (e.g., "Hey EMBODIOS")
4. **Text-to-Speech** for responses

Example Modelfile for voice-enabled system:

```dockerfile
FROM scratch

# Speech recognition model
MODEL huggingface:openai/whisper-tiny

# Main AI model  
MODEL huggingface:microsoft/phi-2

# Enable audio hardware
HARDWARE audio:enabled microphone:enabled speaker:enabled

# Voice capabilities
CAPABILITY speech_recognition
CAPABILITY text_to_speech
CAPABILITY wake_word_detection

ENV EMBODIOS_WAKE_WORD "hey embodi"
ENV EMBODIOS_TTS_VOICE "en-US-Standard-C"
```

## Why Text-First?

1. **Simplicity**: No audio processing overhead
2. **Reliability**: No recognition errors
3. **Accessibility**: Works in noisy environments
4. **Debugging**: Easy to log and replay
5. **Integration**: Simple API for applications

## Voice Use Cases

When voice makes sense:

- **Hands-free operation** (driving, cooking)
- **Accessibility** (vision impaired users)
- **Embedded devices** without keyboards
- **Smart home** integration

## Implementation Notes

To add real voice support:

1. Add audio drivers to kernel
2. Include speech models in bundle
3. Process audio → text → AI → response
4. Optional TTS for spoken responses

The current system is designed to make this addition straightforward when needed, while keeping the core system simple and efficient.
